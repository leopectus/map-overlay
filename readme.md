# How to add an image overlay to map

This project demonstrates how overlay an image to the map, so that it scales with the map. This examples overlays a 19th century map of lower Manhattan on the modern map. I found this public domain map in the digital collection of the [New York Public Library](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/79295a70-daa6-012f-7786-58d385a7bbd0). This project uses the [HERE Maps API for JavaScript](https://developer.here.com/documentation/maps/3.1.19.0/dev_guide/index.html).
